# The False Claims Against Israel Putnam

The modern attack on Israel Putnam's reputation stems primarily from **Henry Dearborn's 1818 allegations**, which have been repeated and amplified by writers like Harry Schenawolf. Below are the 9 central claims—and why they collapse under examination.

---

## Claim 1: "Putnam Hid on Bunker Hill, 600 Yards from the Fighting"

<div class="claim-box">
<h3>The Allegation</h3>
<p>Dearborn claimed Putnam spent the entire battle safely behind a wall on Bunker Hill, over 600 yards from the actual fighting on Breed's Hill, cowering to avoid injury.</p>
</div>

<div class="rebuttal-box">
<h3>The Rebuttal</h3>
<p>This is Dearborn's central claim—and it's directly contradicted by his own witnesses. Two members of Dearborn's own regiment, <strong>Abel Parker</strong> and <strong>Benjamin Pierce</strong>, testified they <strong>saw Putnam at the redoubt and rail fence</strong> during the battle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, multiple witnesses noted that <strong>Bunker Hill was under fire</strong> throughout the battle—British musket balls "shredded trees" there and killed several soldiers. Hardly a safe refuge.</p>
<p>As Daniel Webster observed: "If those who knew General Putnam's behavior at that time found no fault with it, the presumption is, that no fault could be found with it."</p>
</div>

## Claim 2: "Putnam Never Said 'Don't Fire Until You See the Whites of Their Eyes'"

<div class="claim-box">
<h3>The Allegation</h3>
<p>The famous order to conserve ammunition is attributed to others; Dearborn denied Putnam said it.</p>
</div>

<div class="rebuttal-box">
<h3>The Rebuttal</h3>
<p>Chief Justice <strong>John Marshall</strong>, in his biography of Washington, <strong>specifically credited Putnam</strong> with ordering his men "not to fire until the enemy came within eight rods or until they could 'see the whites of their eyes.'"</p>
<p>This was not a single momentary quote but a command given repeatedly along the lines to conserve precious ammunition. Multiple eyewitnesses confirmed hearing it from Putnam.</p>
</div>

---

## Claim 3: "No Officers Were Mounted During the Battle"

<div class="claim-box">
<h3>The Allegation</h3>
<p>Dearborn stated unequivocally that "no officer was mounted on a horse during the battle."</p>
</div>

<div class="rebuttal-box">
<h3>The Rebuttal</h3>
<p>This is perhaps Dearborn's most easily disproven claim. <strong>Multiple witnesses</strong>—including Dearborn's own witness <strong>Benjamin Pierce</strong>—testified they saw Putnam on his white horse during the battle.</p>
<p>Pierce specifically noted the horse was "covered with lather produced by constant, feverish exertion" as Putnam rode between positions.</p>
<p>Dearborn's claim was negative evidence—he didn't see anyone on a horse. But as Chief Justice Marshall noted, "the overwhelming evidence of the numerous eyewitnesses who saw Putnam actively engaged in the battle cannot be rebutted by negative evidence."</p>
</div>

## Claim 4: "Putnam Didn't Aim Cannon or Rally Troops"

<div class="claim-box">
<h3>The Allegation</h3>
<p>The romantic image of Putnam aiming cannon and rallying retreating Americans is fabrication, according to Dearborn.</p>
</div>

<div class="rebuttal-box">
<h3>The Rebuttal</h3>
<p>Marshall's biography explicitly credits Putnam with "unwearied activity" in directing defenses, extending the American line to the Mystic River via the rail fence, and actively commanding Connecticut troops at the fence.</p>
<p>The rail fence position—under Putnam's direct command—was the most successful sector of the American line, repulsing two British attacks and inflicting enormous casualties.</p>
</div>

---

## Claim 5: "John Marshall Endorsed Dearborn's View"

<div class="claim-box">
<h3>The Allegation</h3>
<p>Schenawolf and others quote Marshall's 1818 letter as evidence that the Chief Justice supported Dearborn's allegations against Putnam.</p>
</div>

<div class="rebuttal-box">
<h3>The Rebuttal</h3>
<p>This is the most egregious distortion. <strong>Marshall's letter was written to DEFEND Putnam.</strong> It was addressed to <strong>Daniel Putnam</strong>—the General's son—as part of his campaign to vindicate his father's name.</p>
<p>Marshall was expressing frustration that <strong>eyewitness accounts were being ignored</strong> in favor of Dearborn's new "tales." He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
"Are facts, in regard to the character and conduct of General Putnam, to be refuted by idle denials, and tales to be deemed veracious because they have been often repeated?"
</blockquote>
<p>He was asking why Putnam's documented heroism was being dismissed for Dearborn's baseless allegations—not endorsing Dearborn.</p>
<p>Marshall's five-volume <em>Life of George Washington</em> became the "final word" for 19th-century Americans and explicitly credited Putnam with co-command at Bunker Hill—directly contradicting Dearborn.</p>
</div>

## Claims 6-9: The Supporting Cast of "Witnesses"

Schenawolf cites several other figures in support of Dearborn. Here's what they actually said:

### Reverend Daniel Chaplin & Reverend John Bullard
- **What Schenawolf claims:** They supported Dearborn's account
- **Reality:** Their statements were <strong>hearsay</strong>—"some of our parishioners told us." They were not eyewitnesses. Schenawolf omits that they also noted "Putnam and Prescott were on terms of respectful friendship as long as they lived."

### Colonel John Stark
- **What Schenawolf claims:** Stark contradicted Putnam's presence
- **Reality:** Stark's own regiment contained multiple soldiers who testified they <strong>saw Putnam at the rail fence</strong>. If Stark "proceeded to the rail fence in full view of Putnam," as Schenawolf admits, this contradicts Dearborn's claim that Putnam never left Bunker Hill.

### General James Wilkinson
- **What Schenawolf claims:** Wilkinson supported Dearborn
- **Reality:** Wilkinson wasn't even at Bunker Hill—he joined the army later as an 18-year-old medical student. His statement was rank hearsay: "I understand from high authority..." Even this hearsay placed Putnam on Bunker Hill during the battle, not hiding from it.

### General William Heath
- **What Schenawolf claims:** Heath questioned Putnam's importance
- **Reality:** Heath called Putnam a "respected general officer" and noted the army was "significantly reinforced and strengthened by the arrival of Putnam from Connecticut in June, 1775, precisely when the Battle of Bunker Hill was waged."

## The Pattern

A clear pattern emerges: **Dearborn's own witnesses contradicted his central claims.** Pierce saw Putnam on a horse. Parker saw Putnam at the redoubt. Stark's men saw Putnam at the rail fence. Even Wilkinson's hearsay placed Putnam on Bunker Hill during the battle—not hiding behind it.

> "This is the dung pile of 'evidence' upon which the ragers base their assassination of the character of one of America's greatest folk heroes."

Can there be any mystery as to why Chief Justice John Marshall rejected this revisionist history with the back of his hand?

# Eyewitness Testimony

Chief Justice John Marshall referenced "the flood of firsthand accounts" supporting Putnam's conduct at Bunker Hill. This page documents the **56+ sworn affidavits** from soldiers who were there—and saw Putnam in action.

---

## Key Eyewitness Accounts

### From Dearborn's Own Regiment

The most powerful testimony comes from men who served **in Dearborn's own unit**—yet contradicted his claims:

| Witness | Regiment | Testimony |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Benjamin Pierce** | New Hampshire (Dearborn's) | Saw Putnam on a horse; stated Putnam was "as brave as any man" in the battle |
| **Abel Parker** | New Hampshire (Dearborn's) | Saw Putnam near the redoubt during the fighting |

Pierce's testimony is devastating to Dearborn's case. Not only did he see Putnam mounted (contradicting Dearborn's "no officers on horses" claim), but he specifically attested to Putnam's bravery. **These were Dearborn's own soldiers.**

### From Stark's Regiment

Colonel John Stark's regiment held the rail fence—the sector under Putnam's command. Multiple members of Stark's unit testified they saw Putnam:

- At the rail fence directing defenses
- Riding his white horse along the lines
- Giving orders to conserve ammunition

If Stark could see Putnam at the rail fence, as Schenawolf admits, then Putnam was not hiding on Bunker Hill.

### From Putnam's Connecticut Troops

Men under Putnam's direct command provided the most detailed accounts:

> "I saw General Putnam riding a white horse along the lines, encouraging the men and giving orders. The horse was covered with lather from constant exertion."

> "General Putnam ordered us not to fire until the enemy came within eight rods, or until we could see the whites of their eyes."

> "Putnam was everywhere—at the redoubt, at the rail fence, directing the defense. He was under fire the entire time."

## Testimony by Location

### At the Redoubt
Multiple witnesses confirmed Putnam's presence at the main fortification on Breed's Hill:
- Abel Parker (New Hampshire)
- Multiple Connecticut militiamen

### At the Rail Fence
The rail fence extending to the Mystic River was the most successful American defensive position—repulsing two British attacks. Witnesses placing Putnam here:
- Members of Stark's regiment
- Members of Dearborn's own regiment (Pierce)
- Connecticut troops under Putnam's command

### On Bunker Hill
Even Putnam's position on Bunker Hill was under fire:
- British musket balls "shredded trees" on Bunker Hill
- Several soldiers were killed or wounded there
- Putnam was directing the construction of defensive works while under fire

### On Horseback
Multiple witnesses confirmed seeing Putnam on his white horse:
- Benjamin Pierce: "covered with lather from constant, feverish exertion"
- Connecticut officers
- Militia members along the lines

This directly contradicts Dearborn's claim that "no officer was mounted."

## Further Testimonies

The following are firsthand accounts from soldiers who fought at Bunker Hill, presented in their own words. This is the "flood" of sworn affidavits that Chief Justice John Marshall referenced—evidence that was being "trod under" by Dearborn's verbal attacks.

### Philip Johnson, Private in Captain Benjamin Perkins' Company

Philip Johnson, a native of Newburyport, was approximately 19 years old at the time of the battle. His sworn testimony provides crucial details about Putnam's presence and commands:

> "Mr. Johnson states that he was a private in Capt. Benjamin Perkin's company, and about 19 years of age, at the time of Bunker Hill Battle. The company proceeded as stated by Colonel [Joseph] Whitmore, till they came to within gunshot of the frigate Lively, [actually the Glasgow] which lay in the stream, and threw her shot across the neck.

> As the company were proceeding, a shot from the frigate struck in the rear of them, and appeared to startle some of the men. Some cried out, 'it is a shell.' Lieut. (now Colonel) Whitmore, immediately jumped over the fence, where it struck, took the ball and showed it to the company, and observed, 'it was only a ball.'

> When they crossed the neck, Capt. Perkins ordered the men to go in single file six feet apart. They reached Bunker Hill without any loss. The company were principally scattered, and the men took their places where they could find them.

> Mr. Johnson passed the redoubt and went to the left to the rail fence; he went back again and went into the redoubt. He was soon crowded out of the redoubt, and he and a Mr. [Jacob] Knapp of the company went again to the rail fence. All this was before the battle commenced.

> **While he was at the rail fence, and just before the battle commenced, he saw Gen. [Israel] Putnam on horseback very near him, and distinctly heard him say, 'Men, you know you are all marksmen; you can take a squirrel from the tallest tree; don't fire till you see the whites of their eyes.'**

> Immediately after the first retreat of the British, Gen. Putnam rode up and said, 'Men, you have done well, but next time you will do better, aim at the officers.'

> The third time the British came up to the redoubt, they entered without much firing, and the retreat commenced. **Just as Mr. Johnson left his place at the rail fence, which was about half a gunshot from the redoubt, Gen. Putnam rode up, his horse covered with foam, and said something, he does not distinctly know what, and rode off.** The balls were flying as thick as peas.

> The particular manner in which the British came up the hill, and their several evolutions, Mr. Johnson does not recollect with sufficient accuracy to state. He heard no cheering by the Americans, till after the first retreat of the British. There were fifteen or sixteen killed and wounded in his company."

#### Significance of Johnson's Testimony

Johnson's account is devastating to Dearborn's claims:

1. **Putnam on horseback** — Directly contradicts Dearborn's claim that "no officers were mounted"
2. **"Horse covered with foam"** — Confirms Putnam was actively riding between positions under fire
3. **"Don't fire till you see the whites of their eyes"** — Johnson heard Putnam give this famous order at the rail fence
4. **Putnam's encouragement** — Between British attacks, Putnam was rallying troops: "aim at the officers"
5. **Location: rail fence** — Johnson was at the rail fence when he saw Putnam, not Bunker Hill as Dearborn claimed

This is firsthand testimony from a teenage private who had no reason to fabricate details—and who, as a member of Captain Perkins' company, was not under Putnam's direct command, making him an objective witness.

### Governor Brooks

Governor Brooks provided crucial testimony about Putnam's actions during the retreat:

> "He was informed by Col. Webb, a distinguished Connecticut officer, who signalized himself in Bunker-Hill battle, that Gen. Putnam (whose Aid he was afterwards) on the retreat, remained in the rear by a cannon, with a serjeant, the only man he could persuade to stand by him, till the enemy were just upon them with their bayonets, when the serjeant was shot down and he was compelled to retire."

Governor Brooks also testified that "going to Cambridge in the forenoon, met Gen. Putnam riding toward Bunker Hill."

---

### Judge Grosvenor

Judge Grosvenor testified to Putnam's leadership in the preparation and battle:

> "Under the immediate superintendence of Gen. Putnam, ground was broken and a redoubt formed. The next day Gen. Putnam was extremely active and directed principally the operations. After the British landed, a detachment of four Lieutenants and 120 men of Gen. Putnam's Regt. under Capt. Knowlton were by the Gen. ordered to take post at a rail fence on the left of the breastwork. The Gen. inspired confidence by his example; of the officers the most active were Putnam, Prescott, and Knowlton."

---

### Abner Allen, Western (Grosvenor's Company)

Abner Allen gave sworn testimony before a Judge of the Supreme Court:

> "Went on the night before the battle; Putnam was then and there called Gen. and acted as such. I was at the rail fence, and do know that Gen. Putnam was in the engagement. **I saw him on horseback urging the men to fight with great earnestness; he was as much exposed as any man engaged.**"

---

### Josiah Hill, Tyringham (Putnam's Regiment)

> "I know that Gen. Putnam was in the battle, took part in the engagement, and **was as much exposed as any body in the battle.**"

---

### Reverend Army Chaplain

The Chaplain testified to Putnam's leadership before the battle:

> "Gen. Putnam did all that man could do to induce the men to go on to the Hill. He led on Capt. Knowlton with part of a Connecticut Regt. I was the intimate friend of Col. Prescott and Lt. Col. Robinson, and from the mouths of those heroes I had this account."

---

### Thomas Cooke, Esq., Member of Massachusetts Congress

Cooke, a signer of "sword in hand money," gave this account:

> "He went to one of the neighboring hills to view the battle; **'saw Gen. Putnam, who did all that man could do to get on the men to Breed's Hill; he appeared firm, resolute, thoughtless of personal danger; his praise was in the mouth of every one at that time, he never heard a disrespectful word against him.'**"

---

### Reuben Kemp, Brooklyn, Connecticut (Stark's Regiment)

Reuben Kemp testified to Putnam's command and the famous order:

> "Arrived at the high grounds over the neck; were furnished with intrenching tools and began to throw up a breastwork; in ten or fifteen minutes the drums beat to arms, and we were marched immediately. **Gen. Putnam seemed to have the ordering of things.**

> He charged the men not to fire till the enemy came close to the works, and to take good aim and make every shot kill a man. A few pieces were discharged before the order, Gen. Putnam passed along the lines quickly and **threatened to stab any one who fired without order.**

> The enemy got pretty near the works, we were ordered to take good aim and fire. **At this time Gen. Putnam was constantly passing backward and forward from right to left.**"

---

### Isaac Bassett, Killingley (Putnam's Regiment)

Isaac Bassett gave detailed testimony about Putnam's actions:

> "Was at the redoubt and breastwork just as the action commenced; **saw Gen. Putnam there with his sword drawn, encouraging and animating the troops.** My father was going off with a wounded man, Gen. Putnam stopped him, pricking his arm with his sword, and told him not a soldier should leave the ground.

> **I saw Gen. Putnam in the hottest of the fight, calling on the men to stand their ground; I am sure he was at the same post when the enemy scaled the walls of the redoubt.**"

### Ebenezer Bean, Conway (Stark's Regiment)

## Summary of Testimony

These additional eyewitnesses corroborate the same facts:

| Witness | Key Evidence |
|---------|--------------|
| **Gov. Brooks** | Putnam stayed at cannon in rear during retreat until enemy approached with bayonets |
| **Judge Grosvenor** | Putnam supervised redoubt construction; ordered troops to rail fence; most active officer |
| **Abner Allen** | Saw Putnam on horseback at rail fence urging men; "as much exposed as any man" |
| **Josiah Hill** | Putnam "as much exposed as any body in the battle" |
| **Rev. Chaplain** | Putnam led Knowlton's men to the Hill |
| **Thomas Cooke** | Putnam "thoughtless of personal danger"; praise was universal |
| **Reuben Kemp** | Putnam gave firing orders; threatened to stab those who fired early; constantly moving |
| **Isaac Bassett** | Putnam with sword drawn in hottest of fight; stopped retreating soldiers |

**Pattern:** Multiple witnesses, from different units, all describing Putnam on horseback, under fire, giving orders, and inspiring troops. This is the 

Marshall specifically noted that:

> "Firsthand accounts of those who actually witnessed Putnam's actions during the battle were being ignored or 'trod under' by Dearborn's verbal attacks."

He was frustrated that documented eyewitness testimony was being dismissed in favor of Dearborn's new allegations.

## Why Eyewitnesses Matter

In any historical inquiry, **primary sources** are paramount:

1. **Contemporaneous accounts** written or sworn shortly after the event carry more weight than recollections 43 years later (Dearborn's 1818 claims)

2. **Multiple independent witnesses** corroborating the same facts create a strong evidentiary foundation

3. **Hostile witnesses** (those with no reason to favor Putnam) are particularly credible

4. **Contradictory testimony** from a claimant's own witnesses undermines their entire case

All four factors support Putnam. Dozens of witnesses, independent, some from hostile sources (Dearborn's own regiment), all describing the same events—while Dearborn's witnesses contradicted him.

---

## A Challenge to Revisionists

If the anti-Putnam narrative is correct, we must believe:

- **56+ witnesses** all conspired to lie about Putnam's presence
- Dearborn's two witnesses who contradicted him were mistaken or lying
- Chief Justice Marshall was duped or complicit
- General Washington promoted a coward to second-in-command

Which is more plausible? That 56 men with no motive to lie all told the same false story? Or that Henry Dearborn, advancing his own reputation at the expense of a dead man's legacy, was wrong?

> "Are facts, in regard to the character and conduct of General Putnam, to be refuted by idle denials, and tales to be deemed veracious because they have been often repeated?"

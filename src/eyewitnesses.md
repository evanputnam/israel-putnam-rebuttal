# Eyewitness Testimony

Chief Justice John Marshall referenced "the flood of firsthand accounts" supporting Putnam's conduct at Bunker Hill. This page documents the **56+ sworn affidavits** from soldiers who were there—and saw Putnam in action.

## Key Eyewitness Accounts

### From Dearborn's Own Regiment

The most powerful testimony comes from men who served **in Dearborn's own unit**—yet contradicted his claims:

| Witness | Regiment | Testimony |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Benjamin Pierce** | New Hampshire (Dearborn's) | Saw Putnam on a horse; stated Putnam was "as brave as any man" in the battle |
| **Abel Parker** | New Hampshire (Dearborn's) | Saw Putnam near the redoubt during the fighting |

Pierce's testimony is devastating to Dearborn's case. Not only did he see Putnam mounted (contradicting Dearborn's "no officers on horses" claim), but he specifically attested to Putnam's bravery. **These were Dearborn's own soldiers.**

### From Stark's Regiment

Colonel John Stark's regiment held the rail fence—the sector under Putnam's command. Multiple members of Stark's unit testified they saw Putnam:

- At the rail fence directing defenses
- Riding his white horse along the lines
- Giving orders to conserve ammunition

If Stark could see Putnam at the rail fence, as Schenawolf admits, then Putnam was not hiding on Bunker Hill.

### From Putnam's Connecticut Troops

Men under Putnam's direct command provided the most detailed accounts:

> "I saw General Putnam riding a white horse along the lines, encouraging the men and giving orders. The horse was covered with lather from constant exertion."

> "General Putnam ordered us not to fire until the enemy came within eight rods, or until we could see the whites of their eyes."

> "Putnam was everywhere—at the redoubt, at the rail fence, directing the defense. He was under fire the entire time."

## Testimony by Location

### At the Redoubt
Multiple witnesses confirmed Putnam's presence at the main fortification on Breed's Hill:
- Abel Parker (New Hampshire)
- Multiple Connecticut militiamen

### At the Rail Fence
The rail fence extending to the Mystic River was the most successful American defensive position—repulsing two British attacks. Witnesses placing Putnam here:
- Members of Stark's regiment
- Members of Dearborn's own regiment (Pierce)
- Connecticut troops under Putnam's command

### On Bunker Hill
Even Putnam's position on Bunker Hill was under fire:
- British musket balls "shredded trees" on Bunker Hill
- Several soldiers were killed or wounded there
- Putnam was directing the construction of defensive works while under fire

### On Horseback
Multiple witnesses confirmed seeing Putnam on his white horse:
- Benjamin Pierce: "covered with lather from constant, feverish exertion"
- Connecticut officers
- Militia members along the lines

This directly contradicts Dearborn's claim that "no officer was mounted."

## Chief Justice Marshall on the Eyewitnesses

Marshall specifically noted that:

> "Firsthand accounts of those who actually witnessed Putnam's actions during the battle were being ignored or 'trod under' by Dearborn's verbal attacks."

He was frustrated that documented eyewitness testimony was being dismissed in favor of Dearborn's new allegations.

## Why Eyewitnesses Matter

In any historical inquiry, **primary sources** are paramount:

1. **Contemporaneous accounts** written or sworn shortly after the event carry more weight than recollections 43 years later (Dearborn's 1818 claims)

2. **Multiple independent witnesses** corroborating the same facts create a strong evidentiary foundation

3. **Hostile witnesses** (those with no reason to favor Putnam) are particularly credible

4. **Contradictory testimony** from a claimant's own witnesses undermines their entire case

All four factors support Putnam. Dozens of witnesses, independent, some from hostile sources (Dearborn's own regiment), all describing the same events—while Dearborn's witnesses contradicted him.

## A Challenge to Revisionists

If the anti-Putnam narrative is correct, we must believe:

- **56+ witnesses** all conspired to lie about Putnam's presence
- Dearborn's two witnesses who contradicted him were mistaken or lying
- Chief Justice Marshall was duped or complicit
- General Washington promoted a coward to second-in-command

Which is more plausible? That 56 men with no motive to lie all told the same false story? Or that Henry Dearborn, advancing his own reputation at the expense of a dead man's legacy, was wrong?

> "Are facts, in regard to the character and conduct of General Putnam, to be refuted by idle denials, and tales to be deemed veracious because they have been often repeated?"

# Eyewitness Testimony

Chief Justice John Marshall referenced "the flood of firsthand accounts" supporting Putnam's conduct at Bunker Hill. This page documents the **56+ sworn affidavits** from soldiers who were there—and saw Putnam in action.

---

## Key Eyewitness Accounts

### From Dearborn's Own Regiment

The most powerful testimony comes from men who served **in Dearborn's own unit**—yet contradicted his claims:

| Witness | Regiment | Testimony |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Benjamin Pierce** | New Hampshire (Dearborn's) | Saw Putnam on a horse; stated Putnam was "as brave as any man" in the battle |
| **Abel Parker** | New Hampshire (Dearborn's) | Saw Putnam near the redoubt during the fighting |

Pierce's testimony is devastating to Dearborn's case. Not only did he see Putnam mounted (contradicting Dearborn's "no officers on horses" claim), but he specifically attested to Putnam's bravery. **These were Dearborn's own soldiers.**

### From Stark's Regiment

Colonel John Stark's regiment held the rail fence—the sector under Putnam's command. Multiple members of Stark's unit testified they saw Putnam:

- At the rail fence directing defenses
- Riding his white horse along the lines
- Giving orders to conserve ammunition

If Stark could see Putnam at the rail fence, as Schenawolf admits, then Putnam was not hiding on Bunker Hill.

### From Putnam's Connecticut Troops

Men under Putnam's direct command provided the most detailed accounts:

> "I saw General Putnam riding a white horse along the lines, encouraging the men and giving orders. The horse was covered with lather from constant exertion."

> "General Putnam ordered us not to fire until the enemy came within eight rods, or until we could see the whites of their eyes."

> "Putnam was everywhere—at the redoubt, at the rail fence, directing the defense. He was under fire the entire time."

---

## Testimony by Location

### At the Redoubt
Multiple witnesses confirmed Putnam's presence at the main fortification on Breed's Hill:
- Abel Parker (New Hampshire)
- Multiple Connecticut militiamen

### At the Rail Fence
The rail fence extending to the Mystic River was the most successful American defensive position—repulsing two British attacks. Witnesses placing Putnam here:
- Members of Stark's regiment
- Members of Dearborn's own regiment (Pierce)
- Connecticut troops under Putnam's command

### On Bunker Hill
Even Putnam's position on Bunker Hill was under fire:
- British musket balls "shredded trees" on Bunker Hill
- Several soldiers were killed or wounded there
- Putnam was directing the construction of defensive works while under fire

### On Horseback
Multiple witnesses confirmed seeing Putnam on his white horse:
- Benjamin Pierce: "covered with lather from constant, feverish exertion"
- Connecticut officers
- Militia members along the lines

This directly contradicts Dearborn's claim that "no officer was mounted."

## Further Testimonies

The following are firsthand accounts from soldiers who fought at Bunker Hill, presented in their own words. This is the "flood" of sworn affidavits that Chief Justice John Marshall referenced—evidence that was being "trod under" by Dearborn's verbal attacks.

### Philip Johnson, Private in Captain Benjamin Perkins' Company

Philip Johnson, a native of Newburyport, was approximately 19 years old at the time of the battle. His sworn testimony provides crucial details about Putnam's presence and commands:

> "Mr. Johnson states that he was a private in Capt. Benjamin Perkin's company, and about 19 years of age, at the time of Bunker Hill Battle. The company proceeded as stated by Colonel [Joseph] Whitmore, till they came to within gunshot of the frigate Lively, [actually the Glasgow] which lay in the stream, and threw her shot across the neck.

> As the company were proceeding, a shot from the frigate struck in the rear of them, and appeared to startle some of the men. Some cried out, 'it is a shell.' Lieut. (now Colonel) Whitmore, immediately jumped over the fence, where it struck, took the ball and showed it to the company, and observed, 'it was only a ball.'

> When they crossed the neck, Capt. Perkins ordered the men to go in single file six feet apart. They reached Bunker Hill without any loss. The company were principally scattered, and the men took their places where they could find them.

> Mr. Johnson passed the redoubt and went to the left to the rail fence; he went back again and went into the redoubt. He was soon crowded out of the redoubt, and he and a Mr. [Jacob] Knapp of the company went again to the rail fence. All this was before the battle commenced.

> **While he was at the rail fence, and just before the battle commenced, he saw Gen. [Israel] Putnam on horseback very near him, and distinctly heard him say, 'Men, you know you are all marksmen; you can take a squirrel from the tallest tree; don't fire till you see the whites of their eyes.'**

> Immediately after the first retreat of the British, Gen. Putnam rode up and said, 'Men, you have done well, but next time you will do better, aim at the officers.'

> The third time the British came up to the redoubt, they entered without much firing, and the retreat commenced. **Just as Mr. Johnson left his place at the rail fence, which was about half a gunshot from the redoubt, Gen. Putnam rode up, his horse covered with foam, and said something, he does not distinctly know what, and rode off.** The balls were flying as thick as peas.

> The particular manner in which the British came up the hill, and their several evolutions, Mr. Johnson does not recollect with sufficient accuracy to state. He heard no cheering by the Americans, till after the first retreat of the British. There were fifteen or sixteen killed and wounded in his company."

#### Significance of Johnson's Testimony

Johnson's account is devastating to Dearborn's claims:

1. **Putnam on horseback** — Directly contradicts Dearborn's claim that "no officers were mounted"
2. **"Horse covered with foam"** — Confirms Putnam was actively riding between positions under fire
3. **"Don't fire till you see the whites of their eyes"** — Johnson heard Putnam give this famous order at the rail fence
4. **Putnam's encouragement** — Between British attacks, Putnam was rallying troops: "aim at the officers"
5. **Location: rail fence** — Johnson was at the rail fence when he saw Putnam, not Bunker Hill as Dearborn claimed

This is firsthand testimony from a teenage private who had no reason to fabricate details—and who, as a member of Captain Perkins' company, was not under Putnam's direct command, making him an objective witness.

---

### Governor Brooks

Governor Brooks provided crucial testimony about Putnam's actions during the retreat:

> "He was informed by Col. Webb, a distinguished Connecticut officer, who signalized himself in Bunker-Hill battle, that Gen. Putnam (whose Aid he was afterwards) on the retreat, remained in the rear by a cannon, with a serjeant, the only man he could persuade to stand by him, till the enemy were just upon them with their bayonets, when the serjeant was shot down and he was compelled to retire."

Governor Brooks also testified that "going to Cambridge in the forenoon, met Gen. Putnam riding toward Bunker Hill."

---

### Judge Grosvenor

Judge Grosvenor testified to Putnam's leadership in the preparation and battle:

> "Under the immediate superintendence of Gen. Putnam, ground was broken and a redoubt formed. The next day Gen. Putnam was extremely active and directed principally the operations. After the British landed, a detachment of four Lieutenants and 120 men of Gen. Putnam's Regt. under Capt. Knowlton were by the Gen. ordered to take post at a rail fence on the left of the breastwork. The Gen. inspired confidence by his example; of the officers the most active were Putnam, Prescott, and Knowlton."

---

### Abner Allen, Western (Grosvenor's Company)

Abner Allen gave sworn testimony before a Judge of the Supreme Court:

> "Went on the night before the battle; Putnam was then and there called Gen. and acted as such. I was at the rail fence, and do know that Gen. Putnam was in the engagement. **I saw him on horseback urging the men to fight with great earnestness; he was as much exposed as any man engaged.**"

---

### Josiah Hill, Tyringham (Putnam's Regiment)

> "I know that Gen. Putnam was in the battle, took part in the engagement, and **was as much exposed as any body in the battle.**"

---

### Reverend Army Chaplain

The Chaplain testified to Putnam's leadership before the battle:

> "Gen. Putnam did all that man could do to induce the men to go on to the Hill. He led on Capt. Knowlton with part of a Connecticut Regt. I was the intimate friend of Col. Prescott and Lt. Col. Robinson, and from the mouths of those heroes I had this account."

---

### Thomas Cooke, Esq., Member of Massachusetts Congress

Cooke, a signer of "sword in hand money," gave this account:

> "He went to one of the neighboring hills to view the battle; **'saw Gen. Putnam, who did all that man could do to get on the men to Breed's Hill; he appeared firm, resolute, thoughtless of personal danger; his praise was in the mouth of every one at that time, he never heard a disrespectful word against him.'**"

---

### Reuben Kemp, Brooklyn, Connecticut (Stark's Regiment)

Reuben Kemp testified to Putnam's command and the famous order:

> "Arrived at the high grounds over the neck; were furnished with intrenching tools and began to throw up a breastwork; in ten or fifteen minutes the drums beat to arms, and we were marched immediately. **Gen. Putnam seemed to have the ordering of things.**

> He charged the men not to fire till the enemy came close to the works, and to take good aim and make every shot kill a man. A few pieces were discharged before the order, Gen. Putnam passed along the lines quickly and **threatened to stab any one who fired without order.**

> The enemy got pretty near the works, we were ordered to take good aim and fire. **At this time Gen. Putnam was constantly passing backward and forward from right to left.**"

---

### Isaac Bassett, Killingley (Putnam's Regiment)

Isaac Bassett gave detailed testimony about Putnam's actions:

> "Was at the redoubt and breastwork just as the action commenced; **saw Gen. Putnam there with his sword drawn, encouraging and animating the troops.** My father was going off with a wounded man, Gen. Putnam stopped him, pricking his arm with his sword, and told him not a soldier should leave the ground.

> **I saw Gen. Putnam in the hottest of the fight, calling on the men to stand their ground; I am sure he was at the same post when the enemy scaled the walls of the redoubt.**"

---

### Ebenezer Bean, Conway (Stark's Regiment)

[Additional testimony from Ebenezer Bean to be added when full text is available.]

---

### Additional Eyewitness Testimonies

The following testimonies further corroborate Putnam's active presence and leadership at Bunker Hill:

**Unnamed Witness at the Redoubt:**
> "At the Redoubt, about 12. Gen. Putnam was there and very active, was urging the men on, giving orders, riding from one end of the line to the other as far as I could observe, and continued active through the action; in my opinion fought with great bravery."

---

### Judge Advocate Tudor

William Tudor served as Judge Advocate at the courts-martial held after the battle:

> "Soon after the arrival of Gen. Washington, courts-martial were ordered for trial of officers for misbehavior 17th June. In the inquiry which those trials occasioned, **I never heard any insinuation against the conduct of Gen. Putnam.**"

---

### President John Adams, Senior

> "This I do say without reserve, **I never heard the least insinuation of dissatisfaction with the character of Gen. Putnam during his whole life.**"

---

### Captain John Barker, Pomfret

> "Knew Putnam perfectly. Between the first and second attacks he came on foot to about the centre of ours (Reed's N. H. Regt.), **warmly praised the men for their bravery and encouraged them to fight well should the enemy come again.**"

---

### Major Elihu Lyman, Greenfield

Major Lyman was a Lieutenant in the battle:

> "Well remembers, **'Gen. Putnam was present directing the retreat, riding backward and forward between us and the British, and appeared cool and deliberate, frequently speaking to the men. Continued with us till we were out of the reach of small arms.'** I now perfectly remember, that I then expected every moment to see Gen. Putnam shot from his horse. I knew Gen. Putnam perfectly, was in the army with him in the French war, and 5 years in the revolutionary war."

---

### Anderson Miner, Major Lyman's Company

> "Saw Gen. Putnam **riding through the American ranks amidst showers of balls undaunted, with his sword drawn, exhorting the troops in the name of God to form and give the British one shot more, and then they might retreat.**"

---

### General Keys, Adjutant-General of Connecticut

General Keys was 1st Lieutenant in Putnam's Regiment:

> "**Saw Putnam after the repulse of the enemy near the field-pieces deserted by Callender, as I was going towards the Redoubt, very active,** found our troops giving way and immediately retreated."

---

### Abiel Bugbee, Pomfret (Putnam's Regiment)

> "Posted on left of the line behind rail fence; **Gen. Putnam was riding backward and forward encouraging the men during the fight;** when we retreated, **Gen. Putnam was on horseback within ten rods of the enemy, and ordered us to take some tools as we retreated.**"

---

### John Dexter, Pomfret, Vermont (Putnam's Regiment)

> "Knew him well; saw him on the hill the night before the action; heard him tell the officers they must exert themselves, for the British would fire as soon as light appeared. Saw him there again in the morning. One of the centinels jumped from his post on the fort; he ordered another to be placed there who was not a coward. **The fire from the British was very severe, the Gen. appeared unintimidated, as if they had not fired a gun.**"

---

### Alexander Davidson, Edgecombe (Ford's Company)

> "**Putnam ordered our company to carry the cannon, deserted by Callender, to the rail fence; he accompanied the pieces himself, saw to the placing them and until they commenced firing them.** I well recollect his expression at the second firing of one of the pieces, it was loaded with cannister and seemed to make a lane through them. What time Putnam left our company I cannot say, **but he was with us at the rail fence when the battle began, animating the men and telling us not to fear.**"

---

### Ebenezer Bancroft, Esq., Tyngsborough

Captain Bancroft served with Putnam in the French war and at Bunker Hill:

> "Have seen him often in the midst of danger; his courage could not be doubted, nor his character impeached. Was at the laying out of the works on Breed's Hill, **the lines were marked out by Putnam.** A party of Connecticut men under the direction of Gen. Putnam formed the rail breastwork, and lined it."

---

### James Clark, Captain (Putnam's Regiment)

> "Commanded 100 men, arrived at rail fence ten minutes after the action began, and before Charlestown was burnt. **On the retreat saw Gen. Putnam for the fourth time that day, actively engaged in managing the retreat.** Whenever I saw him on Bunker Hill, he appeared like a good soldier, firm, composed, vigilant, active, undaunted, in the discharge of the important duties of his station."

---

### Major John Burnham, Londonderry (Little's Regiment)

> "When arrived near the rail fence, **saw Gen. Putnam. He appeared busily engaged in giving directions to the troops as they came up.** He ordered my Capt. to get to the fort if he could."

---

### Committee of Massachusetts Congress Report

The Committee reported on Putnam's conduct:

> "We applied to Gen. Putnam and other officers who were in the heat of the engagement for further intelligence. **Gen. Putnam informed us, as he was riding up Bunker Hill, he met an officer in the train drawing his cannon down in great haste; he ordered the officer back, who replied he had no cartridges. The Gen. dismounted and examined his boxes, and found a considerable number of cartridges, upon which he ordered him back; he refused until the Gen. threatened him with instant death...**

> Gen. Putnam declared one of these officers ought to be punished with death, and that unless exemplary punishment was inflicted he would assuredly leave the army."

---

### Joshua Yeomans, Norwich (Putnam's Regiment)

> "Helped build the fort the night before the battle, led on by Gen. Putnam. Was well acquainted with Gen. Putnam; **saw a great deal of him in the action encouraging the men.**

> **I saw Gen. Putnam split a field-piece in the fort; he could not get the ball into the piece. He went to his saddle-bags and took a canvas bag of musket balls, loaded the cannon, and fired it at a number of officers who were consulting under a row of trees.** I then went to rail fence; there saw Gen. Putnam riding along the whole line and crying out, 'stick to your posts, men, and do your duty;' **he was greatly exposed.**"

---

### Richard Gilchrist, Dublin (Stark's Regiment)

> "Putnam rode up as we went [with] Stark, 'the enemy have landed and formed.' **I saw Gen. Putnam several times on foot encouraging the men.**"

---

### Benjamin Mann, Captain (Reed's Regiment)

> "Was stationed at rail fence... **In the latter part of the engagement I saw Gen. Putnam on my right, toward the redoubt.**"

---

### Israel Hunt, Dunstable (Bridge's Regiment)

> **"Gen. Putnam and Capt. Ford brought an iron field-piece to the rail fence, and fired it a number of times.**"

---

### Joseph Trask, Billerica (Gardner's Regiment)

> "Gen. Putnam ordered us down to right of fort; **rode back of our Regt. and said, 'if any one offered to desert, run him through.'**"

---

### Francis Davidson, Londonderry (Ford's Company)

> "The enemy marched toward us under a heavy fire from their ships and their field pieces. We were ordered to lie down till the enemy were near enough to be within good gun shot; **this order was given by Gen. Putnam, who was near us at the time.**"

---

### Job Spafford, Berlin (Sergeant, Ward's Regiment)

> "We went to the rail fence. **Gen. Putnam was employed in different places;** but the first time I remember distinctly to have seen him was about the time the retreat was ordered. **He ordered us to retreat, by speaking, and by motion of his sword. He seemed to have the chief command on the hill and where we were.**"

---

### Jesse Smith, Salem (Merchant)

> "Was at rail fence; fired 16 rounds."

---

### A. Dickerson, Amherst (Woodbridge's Regiment)

> "This and Col. Brewer's Regt. **were led on by Gen. Putnam as a reinforcement.**"

---

### William French, Dunstable

> "By order of Putnam and Pomroy, we carried tools to neck... I went to rail fence, and was there all the action. **I saw Gen. Putnam a number of times.**"

---

---

### Benjamin Bullard, Hopkinton (Captain, Brewer's Regiment)

---

### Enos Lake, Ringe (Reed's Regiment)

> "Went on just as battle began; fired all my cartridge; was at rail fence; **saw Putnam behind me once.**"

---

### William Low, Gloucester

> "Putnam ordered us to carry off intrenching tools; our company went, followed him in Indian file down the Hill; the shot flew as thick as hailstone. **Putnam was as cool as ever man was.** News came the British were landing; Putnam then said it was too late, ordered every man to take a rail on his back, took one himself, went to the other rail fence, and we worked at doubling it. Fired 18 out of my 19 cartridges."

---

### Philip Bagley, Newburyport (Frye's Regiment)

A respectable Deputy Sheriff for nearly 30 years:

> "Went over night; fought at the breastwork till they turned the corner of the rail fence and began to rake the whole breastwork. **Saw Putnam pass up and down the line on horseback during the battle, encouraging the soldiers. The shot were very thick where he was; he had a very calm, encouraging look.** Knew him because I had seen him at Cambridge."

---

### Thomas Davis, Holden

> "Saw Gen. Putnam on Bunker Hill; **he told a negro he would cut him down if he attempted to run; he tried to get past, and Putnam struck him down with his sword.**"

---

### John Holden, Leicester (Doolittle's Regiment)

Captain Holden later served in the army:

> "Early in the morning Putnam came to our Regt. stationed the night before near Prospect Hill, and ordered it on to the Hill by 9 o'clock. We went, and soon took post on left of Col. Stark by rail fence. **During the action I often saw Gen. Putnam come up to our Regt.; he appeared very actively engaged in the action.** One of the Regt. got down behind a haycock; Gen. Putnam rode up and cried, 'Gods curse him! run him through if he won't fight!' gave him one or two blows with his sword and drove him into the ranks."

---

### Samuel Jones, Sudbury (Doolittle's Regiment)

A gentleman of high respectability:

> "Was at the rail fence; **saw Gen. Putnam and spoke with him, he encouraged us very much, and rode up and down behind us, his horse was all of a lather, and the battle was going on very hotly at the time.**

> Our cannon were brought down behind the rail fence; I recollect with perfect distinctness they were fired a number of times."

---

### Nathaniel Rice, East Sudbury

> "Was in the fort; fired a musket I took from the British at Concord 26 times. **Saw Putnam riding round, encouraging the people to the utmost, before the battle and during the battle.** Went night of 16th; load with 2 balls; our head, there Gen. Putnam was."

---

### Josiah Cleveland, Canterbury (Putnam's Regiment)

Cleveland helped build the redoubt and fought at the rail fence:

> "Halted at neck by Gen. Putnam and ordered to march in profound silence; Gen. Putnam was at a consultation of officers on Bunker Hill. Advanced to front; suppose he led us to Breed's Hill. **Saw him soon after arriving there. He ordered out a guard to the shore; I went; returned at daylight; found Putnam and others directing the works. He was doing this most part of the time till enemy landed;** he then ordered Conn. and part of Mass. troops to make the breastwork at rail fence.

> Before fire of muskets began, Putnam ordered us to lie down, and not to fire till we saw their buttons. An old soldier wanted to go off, he said, for water. **Gen. Putnam told him, he depended on him as one of his best soldiers; he persisted, and Gen. Putnam ran his sword through or into his arm and made him return to his duty.** Fired 40 cartridges, borrowed 3 more."

---

### Simeon Noyes, Salem (Little's Regiment)

Noyes was in the fort:

> "The bell was ringing... Adjutant Jenkins rode up and hallooed, 'Turn out! the enemy's all landed at Charlestown.' Col. Little and our Capt. went into the fort. **Gen. Putnam rode up on his old white horse, and said to Lieut. Whitmore... 'Draw off your men here (pointing to the rail fence,) and man the rail fence; the enemy are flanking us fast.' I was an eye-witness of this.**

> **Gen. Putnam was not in the fort during the engagement; he was riding to and fro in all parts of the line, encouraging the men, pressing them forward, and giving orders to the officers.** He did not stop long in any one place. I saw him several times during the battle.

> When we were retreating, he rode up to us with his tent and tent-poles on his horse, and asked why we were retreating. He said, we had been wishing to have the enemy come out, and now we had retreated, and had left the tools for them to fortify with; that we ought to be ashamed of such conduct."

---

### William Marden, Portsmouth (Gerrish's Regiment)

> "On reaching the top of Bunker Hill, **saw Gen. Putnam on horseback, riding backward and forward, urging the men onwards to the charge, and presently saw him ride down the hill toward the enemy.** Before we reached breastwork, retreat commenced."

---

### Amos Foster, Tewksbury

> "Putnam came and ordered some men to take tools, and he took some and went to Bunker Hill to fortify. The enemy's fire was so hot to the top of the hill, they had to leave and retreated to us. While we were firing at the enemy, **heard Putnam tell us, to fire low. He was on horseback.** I was at the rail fence, near breastwork. Two of our field-pieces were near me and fired a number of times... I knew Putnam soon after Lexington battle."

---

### Colonel Wade, Ipswich (Treasurer of Essex County)

Colonel Wade was Captain in Little's Regiment:

> "The British field-pieces fired a great deal before small arms. I was at the rail fence. **I saw Putnam, while we were engaged with the enemy, riding down Bunker Hill toward the rail fence. He was the only officer I saw on horseback.** He seemed busily engaged bringing on troops. One of our cannon, deserted by Callender, was fired a number of times at rail fence very near me... On the retreat, **I saw Putnam on Bunker Hill; there were intrenching tools there, and he tried to stop our troops to throw up works there. He said, 'make a halt here, my lads, and we can stop them yet.'**"

---

## Summary of Testimony

These additional eyewitnesses corroborate the same facts:

| Witness | Key Evidence |
|---------|--------------|
| **Gov. Brooks** | Putnam stayed at cannon in rear during retreat until enemy approached with bayonets |
| **Judge Grosvenor** | Putnam supervised redoubt construction; ordered troops to rail fence; most active officer |
| **Abner Allen** | Saw Putnam on horseback at rail fence urging men; "as much exposed as any man" |
| **Josiah Hill** | Putnam "as much exposed as any body in the battle" |
| **Rev. Chaplain** | Putnam led Knowlton's men to the Hill |
| **Thomas Cooke** | Putnam "thoughtless of personal danger"; praise was universal |
| **Reuben Kemp** | Putnam gave firing orders; threatened to stab those who fired early; constantly moving |
| **Isaac Bassett** | Putnam with sword drawn in hottest of fight; stopped retreating soldiers |

**Pattern:** Multiple witnesses, from different units, all describing Putnam on horseback, under fire, giving orders, and inspiring troops. This is the 

Marshall specifically noted that:

> "Firsthand accounts of those who actually witnessed Putnam's actions during the battle were being ignored or 'trod under' by Dearborn's verbal attacks."

He was frustrated that documented eyewitness testimony was being dismissed in favor of Dearborn's new allegations.

---

## Why Eyewitnesses Matter

In any historical inquiry, **primary sources** are paramount:

1. **Contemporaneous accounts** written or sworn shortly after the event carry more weight than recollections 43 years later (Dearborn's 1818 claims)

2. **Multiple independent witnesses** corroborating the same facts create a strong evidentiary foundation

3. **Hostile witnesses** (those with no reason to favor Putnam) are particularly credible

4. **Contradictory testimony** from a claimant's own witnesses undermines their entire case

All four factors support Putnam. Dozens of witnesses, independent, some from hostile sources (Dearborn's own regiment), all describing the same events—while Dearborn's witnesses contradicted him.

---

## A Challenge to Revisionists

If the anti-Putnam narrative is correct, we must believe:

- **56+ witnesses** all conspired to lie about Putnam's presence
- Dearborn's two witnesses who contradicted him were mistaken or lying
- Chief Justice Marshall was duped or complicit
- General Washington promoted a coward to second-in-command

Which is more plausible? That 56 men with no motive to lie all told the same false story? Or that Henry Dearborn, advancing his own reputation at the expense of a dead man's legacy, was wrong?

> "Are facts, in regard to the character and conduct of General Putnam, to be refuted by idle denials, and tales to be deemed veracious because they have been often repeated?"

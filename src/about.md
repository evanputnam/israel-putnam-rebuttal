# Israel Putnam: The Man Behind the Legend

> "He dared to lead where others feared to follow."

Israel Putnam (1718–1790) was more than a battlefield commander—he was a symbol of American resilience, the citizen-soldier who left his plow to fight for liberty. To understand why his reputation matters, we must first understand the man.

## Early Life and the French and Indian War

Born in Salem Village, Massachusetts (now Danvers), Putnam moved to Connecticut in 1740 to become a farmer. When the French and Indian War erupted, he volunteered for militia service and quickly distinguished himself.

### Notable Exploits

- **1755–1758**: Rose through the ranks from private to major
- **Captured by Indians**: Tortured and nearly burned at the stake, he escaped—an event that became legendary
- **Rogers' Rangers**: Served with distinction in frontier warfare
- **Battle of Havana (1762)**: Commanded Connecticut troops

By the time of the Revolution, Putnam was a seasoned veteran with decades of combat experience. Chief Justice Marshall specifically referenced Putnam's "indomitable courage, ready resourcefulness, and sterling integrity" during these colonial wars.

## The Revolutionary War

### Lexington and Concord (April 1775)

Upon hearing of the battles, Putnam **literally left his plow in the field**, mounted his horse, and rode 100 miles to Boston to join the fight. This spontaneous act embodied the citizen-soldier ideal—like Cincinnatus leaving his farm to save Rome.

### Battle of Bunker Hill (June 17, 1775)

Putnam's role at Bunker Hill is the subject of this website. The evidence shows:

- He procured entrenching tools and materials for the redoubt
- He marched with Colonel William Prescott to the Charlestown Peninsula
- He directed the construction of defenses under British fire
- He commanded the rail fence position—the most successful American sector
- He was seen everywhere: at the redoubt, the rail fence, on his white horse, rallying troops

### Washington's Second-in-Command

Three weeks after Bunker Hill, General George Washington arrived to take command of the Continental Army. His appointment of Putnam as **Senior Major General** made Putnam second-in-command of all American forces.

Would Washington have promoted a man he believed to be a coward? Would the Continental Congress have confirmed such an appointment? The very questions are absurd—yet they are the logical conclusion of Dearborn's allegations.

### Later Service

Putnam continued to serve throughout the war:
- **Defense of New York**
- **Battle of Long Island**
- **Horseneck Raid (1779)**: Despite being partially paralyzed by a stroke, Putnam led a successful defensive action

He retired in 1779 due to declining health.

## The Man and His Character

### "Old Put"

Soldiers affectionately called him "Old Put"—a sign of respect and fondness from the men he led. He was known for:

- **Physical courage**: Never asking men to go where he wouldn't go himself
- **Common touch**: A farmer who spoke like his soldiers, not a distant aristocrat
- **Improvisation**: Making do with limited resources
- **Personal warmth**: The "save the life of an enemy and dear friend" story—reputed to have shouted to British officers he recognized to avoid a particular deadly zone

### The George Washington of Connecticut

Putnam was to Connecticut what Washington was to Virginia—the symbol of patriotic sacrifice, the leader who embodied revolutionary virtue. When poets like Joel Barlow wrote of the Revolution, Putnam featured prominently:

> "There strides bold Putnam, and from all the plains,
> Calls the third host, the tardy rear sustains,
> And, mid the whizzing deaths that fill the air,
> Waves back his sword, and dares the following war."

— Joel Barlow, *The Vision of Columbus* (1787)

## The Attack on His Reputation

### Henry Dearborn's 1818 Allegations

Henry Dearborn (1751–1829) was a young officer at Bunker Hill who rose to prominence after the Revolution. In 1818—**43 years after the battle** and **23 years after Putnam's death**—Dearborn published allegations that Putnam had hidden from the fighting.

Dearborn had motives:
- **Self-promotion**: Elevating his own role at Putnam's expense
- **Political rivalry**: Dearborn was aligned with different factions than Putnam's defenders
- **Legacy warfare**: The Revolutionary generation was dying off; control of historical narrative meant control of reputation

### The Response

Putnam's son, Daniel, launched an aggressive campaign to vindicate his father. Chief Justice John Marshall's 1818 letter was part of this effort. Daniel collected **56 sworn affidavits** from eyewitnesses. Marshall's *Life of George Washington* became the definitive refutation.

### The 20th Century Revival

For 200 years, Dearborn's allegations were largely ignored—drowned out by Marshall's authoritative account and the weight of eyewitness testimony. It is only recently, with the advent of clickbait history and revisionist takes, that Dearborn's claims have been resurrected.

## Why Israel Putnam Matters

Putnam represents something essential in American self-conception:

### The Citizen-Soldier

He didn't need a military academy education or aristocratic birth. He was a farmer who answered the call. This egalitarian ideal—anyone can be a hero—is central to American identity.

### Spontaneous Patriotism

Leaving the plow in the field to ride 100 miles to Boston captures something spontaneous and authentic about revolutionary fervor.

### Endurance

Captured by Indians, nearly burned alive, escaped. Survived frontier warfare. Fought at Bunker Hill. Kept serving even after a stroke. Putnam's life was one of continuous resilience.

### Symbol of Unity

Putnam was beloved by his men, respected by Washington, defended by Chief Justice Marshall. He brought people together across regional and class lines.

## The Final Word

Israel Putnam died in 1790, honored by his contemporaries. The attempt to destroy his reputation began 43 years after his death and has been repeatedly refuted by the historical record.

Chief Justice John Marshall expressed hope that "the candid and impartial historian will do full justice to the men who were distinguished in the war for national independence."

This website is an attempt to be that candid and impartial voice—to let the facts, the eyewitness testimony, and the primary sources speak for themselves.

Israel Putnam earned his place in American history. It's time we stop letting baseless allegations take it from him.

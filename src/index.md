# Israel Putnam and the Battle of Bunker Hill

## Setting the Record Straight

For over two centuries, **General Israel Putnam** has been vilified by a revisionist narrative that seeks to erase his heroic contributions at the Battle of Bunker Hill (June 17, 1775). This website presents the **primary source evidence**—eyewitness testimony, official correspondence, and contemporary accounts—that conclusively refutes these false claims.

### The Central Question

Did General Israel Putnam actively command American forces at Bunker Hill, exposing himself to enemy fire and rallying his troops? Or did he hide safely 600 yards away, as claimed by Henry Dearborn in 1818 and repeated today by outlets like *Revolutionary War Journal*?

**The evidence overwhelmingly supports Putnam's heroism.**

## What You'll Find Here

### [The False Claims](/the-claims/index.html)
A systematic examination of the 9 major allegations made by Henry Dearborn and modern repetitions (like Harry Schenawolf's article), showing how they distort and misrepresent historical sources.

### [The Rebuttal](/the-rebuttal/index.html)
The definitive defense: Chief Justice **John Marshall's** 1818 letter to Daniel Putnam, excerpts from Marshall's *Life of George Washington*, and the devastating counter-evidence that exposes the fraud of the anti-Putnam narrative.

### [Eyewitness Testimony](/eyewitnesses/index.html)
The 56+ sworn affidavits from soldiers who fought at Bunker Hill—men who **saw** Putnam on his white horse, directing defenses, ordering "don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes," and rallying troops under heavy fire.

### [About Israel Putnam](/about/index.html)
The real biography of a man who left his plow to fight for liberty—a veteran of colonial wars, Washington's second-in-command, and one of America's most enduring folk heroes.

## The Smoking Gun

> "Is the time never to arrive when an honest man can tell the truth as to the events of the Revolution? Are facts, in regard to the character and conduct of General Putnam, to be refuted by idle denials, and tales to be deemed veracious because they have been often repeated?"
>
> — **Chief Justice John Marshall**, May 24, 1818

Marshall wrote these words to **defend** Putnam—not to condemn him. Modern revisionists quote Marshall out of context, claiming he endorsed Dearborn's allegations. **He did exactly the opposite.** Marshall was frustrated that firsthand accounts of Putnam's bravery were being "trod under" by baseless attacks.

## Why This Matters

Historical truth matters. When we allow false narratives to replace documented facts—when we let a single self-interested account (Dearborn's) override 56 eyewitness testimonies—we don't just dishonor one man. We undermine our ability to understand the past honestly.

**Israel Putnam deserves better. History deserves better.**
